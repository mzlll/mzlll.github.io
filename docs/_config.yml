During the 1970s, two modes of research dominated the filed of translation. One focused on the literary concern, or hermeneutic analysis, used primarily by individual thinkers who try to arrive at universally valid ideas single-handedly. The other is from linguistic or neopositivistic perspective, focusing on the linguistic data and rejecting any non-scientific approach. Both are not without drawbacks. Literary approach's epistemological assumption is out of date, many theories of which contradict with findings of other disciplines. And logical positivism's approach reduced the study of literature to a language intended for physical science. 

Thus, a compromise and integration was made between them. Translation Studies, originally developed in Low Countries, based its research on an evolutionary concept. It ceased to study translations from a purely theoretical point, and instead turned to numerous cases studies, in hope of learning more about the nature of translation during the procedures. The object of studies was neither an absent core of "meaning" nor deep "linguistic structure, " but rather the translated text itself. 

Such an approach is not devoid of theory, and the very goal of Translation Studies is to formulate a theory of translation after meticulous analyses of different translation texts. Different hypotheses needs be examined, consensus must be made by qualified scholars, and until then can the theory be formulated and used to guide other translation practices.  

The process is not immutable nor fixed, but rather dynamic and evolutionary. Translations are mediations subject to theoretical manipulation and prevailing artistic norms, which will also be reciprocally influenced by the translation. In this sense, translation is both produced and producing. Through the analyses of  the texts, scholars can discern the theories and norms behind the words. 

The roots of early Translation Studies can be found in Russian Formalism.
